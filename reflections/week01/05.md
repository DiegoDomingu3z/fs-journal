# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

Coming in I knew very little about html and css and how they worked together, after this week i can confidently say I know how they work together and what can be done by both to make changes on a document.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

I was surprised how well I was a able to understand the row & col system within bootstrap, I did take some time after class to study and really know the system but after some time it came to me pretty easy. 

- What are you struggling with?

I think I could really use some time working on and studying how to position images and cards, since there are so many functions on how to position them I often find it hard to memorize all of them.

- What would you count as a victory?

Surviving week 1 and finding out I actually really enjoy my struggles, I have found myself having to remind myself to take breaks during long sessions! I would also count finishing my checkpoint with very little help from my TA's as a victory.
