## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

The purpose of wire-framing is to create the basic structure and features of your website, this also helps designing a user focused website. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

The first level is low-fidelity which start off by drawing out the basic layout and building block of your website, the second level is ,id-fidelity which is where you start adding a bit more of design to your layout, this can be adding test weights, headings, body content etc.
The last level being high-fidelity is where you start putting in specific images, adding specific pixels and menu systems.

Each one of these levels is useful to the process of wire-frame because it helps you to not over complicate designing a website, it gives you a road map of where to start and where to finish when web developing.
