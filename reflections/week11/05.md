# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?




This week really nice, being able to review all the material and going over problems that I had a tough time with was just what I needed. I got farther than I thought I would on our final today, I was able to to get two collections done all the way which I think will set me up very well for the weekend.
