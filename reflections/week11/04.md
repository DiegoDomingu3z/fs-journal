## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I really had ups and downs in this course, the first few weeks were really tough, I had never coded before in my life so I didn't really know what to expect. I stayed up countless nights till 3am to keep up and study course work. I hit a point where I thought I couldn't learn fast enough to be able to pass. Luckily I got some perspective from Jeremy and Sam to keep on going and not give up, telling me that the course would get a bit easier if I kept studying every night. This was the first summer in my life I didn't have the same social life I was use to, so that was also really tough for me. Luckily I made it through and I'm so thankful for the instructors and TA's, this was definitely a life changing course for me and I think will set me up for the next chapter in my life.

It was definitely nice to see how different Jake codes compared to Mick or Mark, I think being exposed to different styles is very important not only to challenge yourself to understand it, but knowing that it wil be very common to see this out in the workforce.
