## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing -  allows for isolation testing, which usually give developers confidence in their code.

Component Testing -  Vue components must be mounted virtually or real to fully assert that they are working, has optimal compatibility with the vue ecosystem.

End to End Testing - Validates all the layers in your application.


2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think end to end testing is the most useful, this is because it offers testing not only in your front end, but the back end as well. It gives your real life testing as if real users were using your application, which I think is the most important part of releasing an application, knowing that not only it works for you  but the for the thousands of users that will be using that application.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think unit testing is the least useful, it's testing is still very handy when trying to figure out smaller bugs but I think overall the time it takes to build out tests for smaller units wastes more time when you can be doing bigger loads and go through testing faster.
