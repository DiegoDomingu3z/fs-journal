# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I think our groups communication was what got us as far as we did this week. Knowing when to shout out when we were going into our appState was crucial as that was the file where we all went into and knowing when to push and pull was key. I think I would count our organization as victory this week, we knew exactly what need to be done to be able to move on to the next challenge.
