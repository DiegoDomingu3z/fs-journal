## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

It increases the visibility and authority, shows that you know your craft, helps you stand out as a developer.


2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

It can showcase what you know and how good you are at writing clean code, it can also help employers see what you are passionate about if you like building apps that interest you.


3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

As of now I think I would include my Tower project, our group capstone project and a person social media project that I am currently building, This application is kind of a clone of an app that is already out that is called YikYak, as a community at Boise State most students especially ones in greek life would use this app to communicate where we were holding out parties or just post random things. This application is missing many things that many other students complained about, such as being able to private message or have rewards for the karma you had. My goal is to implement these missing factors that I see many students complain about.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Today went very well, our capstone team worked and communicated very well to share our ideas of what are app should be, we did run into a few barriers throughout the day as we explained out app idea but we were able to overcome them for the most part.
