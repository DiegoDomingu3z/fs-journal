## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We have used a couple libraries for vue animations, on of them being a Vue horizontal which offers almost a way of pagination but it with side scrolling.

2. What went well so far?

I think our progress and pace has gone fairly smooth we've been able to overcome difficult problems pretty quickly.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I think discussing between our group how certain libraries work would have been useful instead of having to go back and read the code later by myself.
