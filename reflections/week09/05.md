# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?



I think our productivity was very well this week, we worked as a team and actually were very well with our daily stand ups and breaks. I would say our communication could have been a little better. We did have a couple merge problems, but overall I am very happy on how our capstone turned out and think it will make a great addition to our portfolios.
