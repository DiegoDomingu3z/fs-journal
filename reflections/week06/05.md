# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I felt really comfortable knowing when to use computed and onMounted for most of the week but I did struggle knowing how to use routes. For the most part I understood the Vue this week but I did struggle remembering some of the syntax and found myself looking back at our daily lectures more often than not.
