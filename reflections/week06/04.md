Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

The biggest takeaway from today was reviewing how to make props and how to properly use them within components, I had found myself struggling with props these past days, so today was a great day to go over those. Another key takeaway from lecture was learning how to use a watchEffect, and how they are used with forms to keep them updated when wanting to create and edit form.
