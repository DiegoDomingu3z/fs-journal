## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

Lifecycle hooks are windows in our library working behind the scenes. They are meant to allow us to know when a component has been created add, updated or destroyed in our DOM.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

I have been using these lifecycle hooks with onMounted when trying to render data to the screen as soon as it loads.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

Mounting hooks tell the dom to draw whatever is in it onto the screen as soon as the page loads. We might want to use these when we want certain information to load as soon as we load on it, for example we used it today to draw our list of jobs, cars, and houses onto the screen as soon as the page loaded.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
The key takeaway from today was learning how to utilize a watchEffect when wanting to run a pice of data inside if it changes. Slots was also part of todays key takeaway's, I can't say I fully understand how they work and how to write the syntax myself yet but I think this will definitely be something I can utilize in future projects to make cleaner and less code.
