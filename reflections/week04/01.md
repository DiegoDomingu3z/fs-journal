> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

Not appropriately naming asynchronous code and nesting a bunch of functions together. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means that the block of code can run in the background and the rest of the code can continue to be read and ran without stopping for the asynchronous code. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments in the asynchronous code, callbacks are essentially the name of it, it calls back once that asynchronous code has been executed successfully or unsuccessfully.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Keeping your code shallow, this means giving appropriate names to your functions and easily readable.

Creating libraries, this keeps your code a lot smaller in the long run and keeps your code neat and legible. 

Handling any error, this means letting your user know that an error has occurred. You want to do this because it all comes down to the user. If the user doesn't know whats going on in your website it is very unlikely they will come back.
