## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
Pending,Resolved,Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Promises make callbacks look a lot cleaner and easier to read, they are attached to promises rather than just passing them through.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() method is called when a promise is resolved and passes through successfully, it is used to determine what to do with this resolved promise.
.catch() method is used when the promise is rejected, we can use catch to determine where our code was rejected.
