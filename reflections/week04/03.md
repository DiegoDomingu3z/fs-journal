## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

Async and Await is the new way of making a promise, async means that the function will return a promise, and await means that the calling of the code will stop until it is resolved or rejected.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

In order to await a promise inside of a function you must async the function. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

It is syntactically easier to write, it also make debugging a lot easer to do compared to promises, this is because the debugger looks at async and await functions as synchronous code and will actually go through it unlike promises which are actually seen as asynchronous code making the debugger to skip over it.
