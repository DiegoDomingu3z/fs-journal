## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

Pair programming went really well this week for the most part, me and my partner really had great communication and knew the responsibilities of the navigator and the driver. 

2. What went well this week?

I really think remembering how to do back end was the highlight of this week, coming in monday and seeing Mark build out the back was kind of scary because seeing how fast he was able to write it and me not being able to remember and keep up was scary but after yesterday and writing it out myself was great because most of it came back to me. 

3. What would you do differently?

If I could go back and start the back end again from scratch I think I would focus on trying to create them faster, I feel like I have a better understanding of them now that I can try to focus on building of my speed because I feel like this is going to be a road block when it comes to finding a job and employers might think that I may be to slow at coding.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today I started my front end and found myself struggling a little finding out how to use ref as an empty string and filter the data within the computed to filter out the concerts, filters etc. After some clarification from Mick I was able understand how to set it up and was able to find the solution after some time.
