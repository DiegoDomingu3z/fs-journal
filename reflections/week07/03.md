## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

A user experience is every interaction a user has with your app or website, allowing a user to easily navigate through your website and allowing them to do what they want should be considered when developing a good user experience. 

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

We can add a better understanding and visual experience to our projects allowing for more diversification of our projects, having that user experience in your back of your mind while building out your application really makes you think as a developer and a customer, it makes you think if I was the customer or client how would I judge this work or experience. 

3. Why is the User Experience important?

User experience is vital in the web development world, you mind have a huge understanding of front end development but if you can't add that nice user experience to your projects it will be just as hard to gain credibility. Without a nice user experience clients won't find your websites attractive and wont want to visit them.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today I start building out the back end for our TOWER project, I didn't really struggle building it out other than running into a problem with populating my tickets which turned out to be bad data in my database that was making my get Tickets by id test to fail, the simple solution was to just clear the data in mongoose, other than that I was able to build out the whole back end within 10 hours of work in total.
