# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I really think building out the back went the most smoothly, which was kind of a shock to me because coming into this week I was a little terrified I wasn't going to remember how to use Node. I would say I struggled the most with the front end, I feel like I still don't have a really solid understanding of how to put my logic into functioning code. I can write down the sudo code and know exactly what I need to do but sometimes I struggle putting it into code and usually find myself asking for help which I really want to minimize at this point of the course.
