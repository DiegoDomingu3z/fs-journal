# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I think this week really went well for me, I really got a good understanding of how the mvc pattern works and even made javascript a bit easier to understand, I will say the only part that really got me from the mvc pattern was knowing how and when to create listeners. 
Being able to create my checkpoint project without much help would be my victory of the week.
