## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

It solves the problem of having to write the same function or variable in different files, using export you can just transfer them without having to write out the whole line of code out.

2. How does export differ from export default?

Export only exports one variable while using export default you can export multiple at a time which can save time.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Code can be split into smaller files, which helps with formatting. 
Debugging can also become much easier
