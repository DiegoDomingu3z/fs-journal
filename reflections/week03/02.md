## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Its pretty much like a membrane of a cell, encapsulating allows for the data within to be acted upon by the methods that are within that function, and only those methods have access to do that.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

The variable that was trying to be updated or changed couldn't be so we had to add a proxyState.on to be able to manipulate whatever we were trying to do. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

You create them before you insert the "export" you would want to do this if you don't want the user to be able to manipulate the variable of function.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today I got a better understanding of how the service is in charge of getting the information needed from the proxyState and then creating a function(or creating the dinner), then delivering it to the controller (waiter) where he then delivers it to the the main js.
