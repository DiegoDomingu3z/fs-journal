## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are strongly typed values, they are a set of values that you assign and ones that can only be used. Enums can be used when you want a user to specifically choose from a set of values.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

You can change the base number and type of a value in an enum, for example the first value of an enum has a value of 0, you could change it to whatever number you would want.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could).
    I have not used enums in C# yet but I have used them in node, this was when we had to let the user choose what type of event they were making in our Tower checkpoint.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today was quite confusing when learning about many to many relationships, I really didn't get the way why we were making another class in our models and then using that class model in our Repository to grab information from there.
