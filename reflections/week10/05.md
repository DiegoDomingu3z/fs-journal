# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory? 

Overall this week was very tough for me, I still find myself struggling to remember the syntax specifically for the Repository file, I found myself having to look back at references more than I would have wanted to. I hope by completing the All Spice checkpoint and having all next week to review will help me remember the syntax and hopefully be prepared for the final next friday.
