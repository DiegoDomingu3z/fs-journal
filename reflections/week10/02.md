## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

List is kind of the equivalent of an array in JavaScript, it can contain multiple things in it where we can add, delete or update the things in it.


2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

List.Add, List.Contains. List.find

I think there will be many cases where we will have add something into a list, as well as finding something in that list and being able to know if a certain thing exists in that list.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I could use the method .Find, this method makes it very simple to find an item with a unique id or character or int to them.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today wasn't as hard to understand compared to when learning js mvc for the first time, I was able to understand what Mark was doing a lot more and knowing why he was doing it. The only thing that I think I will have trouble with in the incoming days is learning the syntax and being able to write the whole server without having to look back at references.
