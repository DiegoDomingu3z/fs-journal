## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type - holds data value within its own memory space

Reference type - does not directly hold the value, instead it holds the address of where that value is stored

Pointer type -  usually called a referent type, can be changed into integral types.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool
byte
char
decimal
double
enum
float
int = number
long
sbyte
short
struct
uint
ulong
ushort




3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types are stored in memory somewhere else, it tells us where to go to find where the data is stored but it can still call to that place to get data. Unlike value types, they store memory right where they are placed.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today was really fun building out the rock paper scissors game in our console. learning about console.ReadLine() was very fun to play around with and learning the while(){}, I will say I did struggle a bit making the game and found another to complete the project by using an array for the AI to choose r,p,c randomly and compared the outcomes to the input.
