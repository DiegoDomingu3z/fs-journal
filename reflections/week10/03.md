## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

    Columns are a specific value, for example a column could be houseId, now all the values down that column would be id's of houses that are in that database, row contains all the information of the instance of the table created. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE
    IF NOT EXISTS characters(
        id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        age INT NOT NULL,
        description TEXT
    ) default charset utf8;

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

Delete FROM will delete all rows from the table,
DROP will get rid of all data in that table and the table itself
```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today was went well learning about SQL, creating a table does not seem to hard although I did struggle a bit making my own because of a simple comma I had misplaced, the article that was sent in slack was also very helpful when knowing how to insert or delete from a table.
