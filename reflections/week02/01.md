## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope means where variables are available for use, for instance, this could be globally meaning variables can be declared outside of a function, another term is function/ locally scoped meaning the variable can only be accessed within the function. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

When variables and function declarations are moved to the top od their scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let is preferred for variable declaration, Var would be useful to use when you want to use a variable globally. Const would be useful when you want to maintain constant values.
