Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today I learned how you can filter objects and get properties form different data types, this being strings, numbers, and booleans. I also learned how you can you multiple functions to work together, what I mean by this is how we were able to manipulate our data stored in our object and filter out the object with each function, these functions worked together to filter the data until we reached the data we wanted. Another takeaway was how you can insert an element into HTML through javascript, for example we were able to display the tracking numbers and names onto our screen though javascript and html.
