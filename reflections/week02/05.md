# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

What went most well this week was being able to write alias for a for loop, as well as being able to pull data from objects and arrays.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

What I learned as a surprise was being able to to write  a dictionary and figuring out how to access specific data within the the dictionary.

- What are you struggling with?

What I'm most struggling at the moment is being able to remember and determine when functions should be called on java and when I should enter a parameter into functions when needed.

- What would you count as a victory?

I would count being able to add innerHTML onto the html page and being able to manipulate data within an array and an object.
