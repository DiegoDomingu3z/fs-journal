# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

I think I got a really good understanding of how relationships work in node and how we can create those relationships. I was really excited to see how the backend ties in with the front end this week which was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. The biggest thing I found myself struggling with was knowing how to get virtual properties and how to populate.
