## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Devoting a specific amount of time to a certain task and finishing that task within that time frame.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Break Parkinsons law, I will start giving myself less time for certain tasks and see if I can push myself to get the same amount of work done within that time frame, but I think this strategy will a trial and error plan.

Being flexible with time boxing, I think going over my timebox will happen more often than not. Which means I have to be flexible with my timebox plannings.

Prioritization: I will start giving more value to bigger tasks and try to solve them before doing anything else.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Just last week for checkpoint 4 I was devoting time to finish one task at a time. For example devoted time to get my clock to work before I moved on to another requirement.
