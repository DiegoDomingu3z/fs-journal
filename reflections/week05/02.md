## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

1:1 Relationship, 1:Many, Many to Many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Linking does not increase the document size, documents only have 16mb of storage so if you have a lot of information it would probably be best to just link.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?


I think the more many to many relationships a model has the bigger the model gets which ultimately leads me to create that model last.
